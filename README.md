# Family Budgeting Tool (Team 7)

A Django-based web application that allows users to manage their personal and family budgets collaboratively. Each user can create an account, join or create a family group, edit their income and expenses, and view aggregated data for their group members.
This project follows modern CRUD fundamentals, Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices, and applies principles inspired by Arjan Codes’ functional programming techniques and avoidance of common OOP anti-patterns.

## Features 
Authentication  
User registration   
Login and logout system  
Redirect control for authenticated users  
Secure session management  

### User Profiles

Each user has a unique profile linked via one-to-one relationship  
Editable income and expense values  
Simple, intuitive profile editor with form validation

### Family Groups

Users can create or join a family group using a unique group code  
Only one active family group per user  
Group creator automatically becomes the admin  
Group members can view all other members’ income and expenses  
Clear role display (Admin / Member)  

### Dashboard

Personalized dashboard after login
Quick access to profile, family group, and logout options

## Testing

Comprehensive unit tests for authentication, signup, profile management, and group logic
